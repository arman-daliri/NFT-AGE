# NFT Art Generation Engine (NFT-AGE)

A simple tool to create unique NFT artwork by combining different image layers.

## 2. Configuration Settings

When you first open the app, you'll see the Configuration tab with these important settings:

- **Supply**: Enter how many NFT images you want to create (example: 5)
- **Name**: Your collection name (example: "Nima NFT Arts")

1. Go to the "Layers Order" tab
2. Click "Get Folders" - the app will automatically find your layer folders
3. Your layers will appear in a list

- Use PNG format for best results
- The preview might look messy, but your final NFTs will be perfect
- Try different layer orders for new looks
- If you want to add your own layer folders, make sure to follow the structure below:
   ```
   layers/
   ├── Background/
   ├── Body/
   ├── Eyes/
   ├── Mouth/
   └── Accessories/
   ```
